College-bound seniors are those students that complete the SAT Questionnaire when they register for the SAT and identify that they will graduate from high school in a specific year. For example, the 2010 college-bound seniors are those students that self-reported they would graduate in 2010. Students are not required to complete the SAT Questionnaire in order to register for the SAT. Students who do not indicate which year they will graduate from high school will not be included in any college-bound senior report.  

Students are linked to schools by identifying which school they attend when registering for a College Board exam. A student is only included in a school’s report if he/she self-reports being enrolled at that school.

Environment,Landcover Raster Data (2010),Environment/Landcover-Raster-Data-2010-/9auy-76zt,Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR),"High resolution land cover data set for New York City.  This is the 3ft version of the high-resolution land cover dataset for New York City. Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces.  The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at 3 square feet. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were the 2010 LiDAR and the 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  Ancillary data sources included GIS data (city boundary, building footprints, water, parking lots, roads, railroads, railroad structures, ballfields) provided by New York City (all ancillary datasets except railroads); UVM Spatial Analysis Laboratory manually created railroad polygons from manual interpretation of 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  The tree canopy class was considered current as of 2010; the remaining land-cover classes were considered current as of 2008. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) techniques were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets.  OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets.  Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process.  A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. More than 35,000 corrections were made to the classification.  Overall accuracy was 96%. This dataset was developed as part of the Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) Assessment for New York City.  As such, it represents a 'top down' mapping perspective in which tree canopy over hanging other features is assigned to the tree canopy class.  At the time of its creation this dataset represents the most detailed and accurate land cover dataset for the area. This project was funded by National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council (NUCFAC) and the National Science Fundation (NSF), although it is not specifically endorsed by either agency.  The methods used were developed by the University of Vermont Spatial Analysis Laboratory, in collaboration with the New York City Urban Field Station, with funding from the USDA Forest Service.",NYC OpenData,http://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/users/5fuc-pqz2,"dpr, landcover, tree, canopy, grass, water, buildings, roads, paved, raster, healthy living, #cleanweb, #education, #environment, bigapps, big apps"

Environment,NYC Urban Tree Canopy Assessment Metrics 2010,Environment/NYC-Urban-Tree-Canopy-Assessment-Metrics-2010/hnxz-kkn5,Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR),"Tree Canopy (TC) Assessment metrics for New York City.  This dataset consists of TC metrics summarized to several different sets of geographic base layers. The metrics presented in this table are based on 2010 high resolution land cover dataset.

The TC Assessment is a top-down approach to analyzing the forest.  Its purpose is to integrate high resolution land cover data with other GIS datasets to produce a set of detailed metrics on the forest that allow decision makers to know how much tree canopy currently exists (termed Existing TC) and amount of land where is it biophysically feasible to establish tree canopy on (termed Possible TC). 

Existing TC is determined by extracting all features classified as tree canopy from a high resolution land cover dataset.  Possible TC is determined by identifying land where canopy could possibly exist.  Possible TC in a GIS context is determined by overlaying high resolution land cover with cadastral and planimetric datasets to include building polygons and road polygons.  

Possible TC is queried out from this overlay and consists of all land that was not existing canopy, not water, not a building, and not a road.  Possible TC is further divided into two subcategories:  Possible-impervious and Possible-vegetation.  Possible-impervious consists of all impervious land that, through modification, could support tree canopy.  Examples of such features are parking lots, driveways (through overhanging coverage) and playgrounds.  Possible-vegetation consists of all land that is low-lying vegetation, primarily grass or shrubs, which could conceivably be converted to support tree canopy.  Examples of such features include residential lawns and playing fields.  TC metrics do not serve to address the issues of where it is socially desirable or financially feasible to plant trees.  Rather, the TC metrics serve as the basis for beginning to form answers to these questions.   

TC metrics are presented in the attribute table as both absolute area (in map units) and relative area (percentage of land area) per parcel.  For example, an Existing TC Area (TC_E_A) value of 13,677 and an Existing TC Percentage (TC_E_P) of 21.8 indicate that for the parcel in question the area of Existing TC is 13,677 (in map units) and 21.8% of that feature is tree canopy.   This assessment was completed by the University of Vermont's Spatial Analysis Laboratory with funding from National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council (NUCFAC) and the National Science Fundation (NSF) and in cooperation with the USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station.

The TC Assessment protocols were developed by the USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station and the University of Vermont's Spatial Analysis Laboratory in collaboration with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.  TC assessments have been conducted for numerous communities throughout the U.S. where the results have been instrumental in helping to establishing TC goals.",NYC OpenData,http://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/users/5fuc-pqz2,"dpr, landcover, tree, canopy, grass, water, buildings, roads, paved, healthy living"

Survey results provide insight into a school's learning environment and contribute a measure of diversification that goes beyond test scores on the Progress Report. NYC School Survey results contribute 10% - 15% of a school's Progress Report grade (the exact contribution to the Progress Report is dependant on school type). Survey questions assess the community's opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school's strengths and target areas for improvement. 

The NYC School Survey helps school leaders understand what key members of the school community say about the learning environment at each school. The information captured by the survey is designed to support a dialogue among all members of the school community about how to make the school a better place to learn. 

New York City parents, students, and teachers reached new all-time participation highs on the 2011 School Survey. 960,191 surveys were submitted.",NYC OpenData,http://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/users/5fuc-pqz2,lifelong learning

Peer indices are calculated differently depending on School Level.  Schools are only compared to other schools in the same School Level (e.g., Elementary, K-8, Middle, High)

1) Elementary & K-8 - peer index is a value from 0-100.  We use a composite demographic statistic based on % ELL, % SpEd, % Title I free lunch, and % Black/Hispanic.  Higher values indicate student populations with higher need

2) Middle & High - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  For middle schools, we use the average 4th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 4th grade test scores.  For high schools, we use the average 8th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 8th grade test scores.  Lower values indicate student populations with higher need

3) D84 / Charter Schools - the overall score does not include the results of the learning environment survey. 

4) Schools for Transfer Students - consists of schools with large populations of high school students transferring from NYC High Schools or from out of state/country.  No peer index value is assigned because this set of schools is its own peer group. The reports contain 3 categories with one additional credit section.  Unlike the HS Progress Report, the Environment Category is only composed of Survey Results.  Performance measures 6-year graduation rate and Progress captures student level improvements in attendance, credit accumulation and Regents passed.

Survey results provide insight into a school's learning environment and contribute a measure of diversification that goes beyond test scores on the Progress Report. NYC School Survey results contribute 10% - 15% of a school's Progress Report grade (the exact contribution to the Progress Report is dependent on school type). Survey questions assess the community's opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school's strengths and target areas for improvement. 

The NYC School Survey helps school leaders understand what key members of the school community say about the learning environment at each school. The information captured by the survey is designed to support a dialogue among all members of the school community about how to make the school a better place to learn. New York City parents, teachers, and students reached new participation heights on the 2010 School Survey. 922,694 surveys were submitted.",NYC OpenData,http://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/users/5fuc-pqz2,lifelong learning

For high schools, we use the average 8th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 8th grade test scores, % SpEd, and % Overage.

#Grade 9 not in high schools
##Indicates how special class is delivered

For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. 

The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. 

The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, “cluster” teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers.",NYC OpenData,http://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/users/5fuc-pqz2,lifelong learning

Peer indices are calculated differently depending on School Level.  Schools are only compared to other schools in the same School Level (e.g., Elementary, K-8, Middle, High)

1) Elementary & K-8 - peer index is a value from 0-100.  We use a composite demographic statistic based on % ELL, % SpEd, % Title I free lunch, and % Black/Hispanic.  Higher values indicate student populations with higher need.

2) Middle & High - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  For middle schools, we use the average 4th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 4th grade test scores.  For high schools, we use the average 8th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 8th grade test scores, % SpEd, and % Overage.

The time it takes the NYPD to resolve substantiated cases is measured from the date that the CCRB physically transferred the case file to the department until the last day of the month in which the department closed the case. The department does not inform the CCRB of its actual disposition date —just the month in which it closed the case. In addition, when the Department Advocate's Office refers a case to a commanding officer for the imposition of a command discipline, the NYPD considers the case closed and reports that closure to the CCRB. It is subsequent to this closure date that the commanding officer decides upon a penalty consistent with the level of command discipline proscribed by the Department Advocate's Office. For cases that proceeded to administrative hearings, the time it takes for judges to render written decisions is included in calculating the department's closure time.

#Grade 9 not in high schools
##Indicates how special class is delivered

For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. 

The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. 

The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, “cluster” teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers.",NYC OpenData,http://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/users/5fuc-pqz2,lifelong learning

Starting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.

SOURCES: 10/31/06 Official Register (K-9) and 12/15/06 Register/Schedule (9-12)
#Grade 9 not in high schools
##Indicates how special class is delivered

For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. 

The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. 

The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, “cluster” teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers.",NYC OpenData,http://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/users/5fuc-pqz2,lifelong learning

Notes:
As of 2006, the New York State Education Department expanded the ELA and mathematics testing programs to Grades 3-8. Previously, state tests were administered in Grades 4 and 8 and citywide tests were administered in Grades 3, 5, 6, and 7.
In 2006, NYSED treated District 75 students as a distinct geographic district. For 2007-2011, District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. Spreadsheets for District and Borough do not include District 75 students in 2006.
Starting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.

#Grade 9 not in high schools
##Indicates how special class is delivered

For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. 

The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. 

The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, “cluster” teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers.",NYC OpenData,http://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/users/5fuc-pqz2,lifelong learning

SOURCES: 10/31/06 Official Register (K-9) and 12/15/06 Register/Schedule (9-12)
#Grade 9 not in high schools
##Indicates how special class is delivered

For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. 

The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. 

The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, “cluster” teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers.",NYC OpenData,http://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/users/5fuc-pqz2,lifelong learning

Survey questions assess the community's opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school's strengths and target areas for improvement.

In 2007, the New York State Education Department updated its testing policy for English Language Learners: ELLs in an English Language School System for more than one year are required to take the ELA exam.

City Government,LAW Public Service Program,City-Government/LAW-Public-Service-Program/yk6f-pa7p,Law Department (LAW),"Early in his tenure at the Law Department, Corporation Counsel Michael A. Cardozo initiated the Public Service Program - a private/public partnership with the City's prominent law firms, where firms either lend their attorneys to the Law Department for a finite period of time or agree to take on City cases in-house. The Program benefits both the City and the law firms. The City receives the assistance of an incredibly well-trained and talented group of attorneys while the attorneys receive the kind of hands-on, in-court litigation experience that is often hard to come by at the best private law firms. While participation in the Program will not lead to offers of permanent employment at the Law Department, it will enable the volunteers to keep their skills fresh while serving the public. 
Trial Attorney Volunteers: A number of firms lend mid-level litigation associates to the Law Department for a period of four to six months to work full-time in our Tort Division trial units. These attorneys conduct back-to-back civil trials, selecting juries, examining and cross-examining witnesses and presenting opening statements and closing arguments.
Law Firm Volunteers: Other firms have chosen to take entire matters in-house, giving their attorneys the chance to participate in court conferences, settlement negotiations, depositions, and, ultimately, trials.
Deposition Program: Firms also lend associates to the Law Department either to conduct a series of depositions in an individual case or to spend two to three weeks in our offices conducting back-to-back depositions in a variety of cases.",NYC OpenData,http://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/users/5fuc-pqz2,"law, justice, legislation, law public service program"

Graduates are defined as those students earning either a Local or Regents diploma and exclude those earning either a special education (IEP) diploma or GED. For the most recent cohort, graduation rates as of both June and August (including summer graduates) are reported. 

•Records with cohorts of 20 students or less are suppressed. August outcomes are only reported for the most recent cohort. 

•August outcomes include all June and August graduates. 

•In school-level reporting, students who were in a school for less than 5 months are not included in the school’s cohort, but are included in citywide totals.

Peer indices are calculated differently depending on School Level.  Schools are only compared to other schools in the same School Level (e.g., Elementary, K-8, Middle, High)

1) Elementary & K-8 - peer index is a value from 0-100.  We use a composite demographic statistic based on % ELL, % SpEd, % Title I free lunch, and % Black/Hispanic.  Higher values indicate student populations with higher need

2) Middle & High - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  For middle schools, we use the average 4th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 4th grade test scores.  For high schools, we use the average 8th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 8th grade test scores.  Lower values indicate student populations with higher need

3) D84 / Charter Schools - the overall score does not include the results of the learning environment survey. 

4) Schools for Transfer Students - consists of schools with large populations of high school students transferring from NYC High Schools or from out of state/country.  No peer index value is assigned because this set of schools is its own peer group. The reports contain 3 categories with one additional credit section.  Unlike the HS Progress Report, the Environment Category is only composed of Survey Results.  Performance measures 6-year graduation rate and Progress captures student level improvements in attendance, credit accumulation and Regents passed.

Education,Scores,Education/Scores/ybx6-hz63,Department of Education (DOE),"2006/07 Progress Report results for all schools (data as of 1/14/09)

Peer indices are calculated differently depending on School Level.  Schools are only compared to other schools in the same School Level (e.g., Elementary, K-8, Middle, High)

1) Elementary & K-8 - peer index is a value from 0-100.  We use a composite demographic statistic based on % ELL, % SpEd, % Title I free lunch, and % Black/Hispanic.  Higher values indicate student populations with higher need

2) Middle & High - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  For middle schools, we use the average 4th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 4th grade test scores.  For high schools, we use the average 8th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 8th grade test scores.  Lower values indicate student populations with higher need

3) D84 / Charter Schools - the overall score does not include the results of the learning environment survey. 

4) Schools for Transfer Students - consists of schools with large populations of high school students transferring from NYC High Schools or from out of state/country.  No peer index value is assigned because this set of schools is its own peer group. The reports contain 3 categories with one additional credit section.  Unlike the HS Progress Report, the Environment Category is only composed of Survey Results.  Performance measures 6-year graduation rate and Progress captures student level improvements in attendance, credit accumulation and Regents passed.  The additional credit section rewards schools demonstrating exceptional achievement (11 credits or more earned per year) among overage/under-credit populations.",Gdeards,http://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/users/sq3q-v8hy,""

Education,Scores2,Education/Scores2/d7vk-uppq,Department of Education (DOE),"2006/07 Progress Report results for all schools (data as of 1/14/09)

Peer indices are calculated differently depending on School Level.  Schools are only compared to other schools in the same School Level (e.g., Elementary, K-8, Middle, High)

1) Elementary & K-8 - peer index is a value from 0-100.  We use a composite demographic statistic based on % ELL, % SpEd, % Title I free lunch, and % Black/Hispanic.  Higher values indicate student populations with higher need

2) Middle & High - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  For middle schools, we use the average 4th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 4th grade test scores.  For high schools, we use the average 8th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 8th grade test scores.  Lower values indicate student populations with higher need

3) D84 / Charter Schools - the overall score does not include the results of the learning environment survey. 

4) Schools for Transfer Students - consists of schools with large populations of high school students transferring from NYC High Schools or from out of state/country.  No peer index value is assigned because this set of schools is its own peer group. The reports contain 3 categories with one additional credit section.  Unlike the HS Progress Report, the Environment Category is only composed of Survey Results.  Performance measures 6-year graduation rate and Progress captures student level improvements in attendance, credit accumulation and Regents passed.  The additional credit section rewards schools demonstrating exceptional achievement (11 credits or more earned per year) among overage/under-credit populations.",Gdeards,http://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/users/sq3q-v8hy,""

In addition to the numbers of students earning Advanced Regents Designation on their diplomas, another metric was developed based on performance on Math and ELA Regents exams. The Math/ELA APM represents the percentage of students in the cohort who graduated with any regular diploma (Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation, Regents Diploma, or Local Diploma) and who scored 80 or greater on their highest mathematics Regents and 75 or greater on the English Regents. Since this metric is new for the Class of 2010, only one year of results is reported, separately for June and August graduation cohorts. The total number of students in the cohort is the same in June and August. 
¶•Records with cohorts of 20 students or less are suppressed. 
¶•August outcomes include all June and August graduates. 
¶•In school-level reporting, students who were in a school for less than 5 months are not included in the school’s cohort, but are included in citywide totals. 
¶•School level results are not presented for District 79 schools, but their outcomes are included in citywide totals. 
¶•Schools that had previously obtained a waiver to use alternative assessments (rather than Regents examinations) were omitted from the Math/ELA APM calculations.",ahubel,http://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/users/fqgv-haue,lifelong learning

NOTES:
1Debt service is the cost to New York City of repaying its outstanding debt, including both principal and interest. The figures in the table have been adjusted to reflect debt service that was originally scheduled for payment in each year since 2000.
2By law, New York City is required to have a balanced annual budget. In years when it runs a surplus, the primary means the city uses to comply with this requirement is to use up some or all of the surplus by prepaying some of the subsequent years’ debt service expenses. As a result, the cash outlay for debt service in a given year is not an accurate representation of the true cost of debt service in that year. 
3The defeasance of $536 million of GO Bonds in 2007 for reduced debt service in 2008, 2009, and 2010.  Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.                                                                                                                                                                     4The defeasance of $1.986 billion of GO bonds in 2008 reduced debt service in 2010.

City Government,NYC Independent Budget Office (IBO) Debt Outstanding Since FY 2000,City-Government/NYC-Independent-Budget-Office-IBO-Debt-Outstanding/5i9t-mvdt,NYC Independent Budget Office (IBO),"Amount of debt outstanding as of June 30 of each year.

SOURCES: IBO; New York City Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of the Comptroller (various years); Annual Report of the Comptroller on Capital Debt and Obligations (various years); New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (various years)
NOTES: 1In determining what to include as outstanding debt of the City of New York, IBO considered: (1) the city's obligation (contractual and moral) to repay the debt, (2) whether the revenues pledged toward the repayment of the debt would have otherwise accrued to the city, and (3) whether the proceeds of the debt issuance accrue directly to the city.
2GO debt is net of bonds held for debt service on other city-related obligations, referred to in the Comptroller's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) as Treasury Obligations. The 2000–2002 CAFRs show outstanding general obligation debt, before Treasury Obligations, in 2000 and 2001 as $26,892 million and $26,836 million, respectively. However, CAFRs from 2003 on show higher GO debt for the two years, $353 million more for 2000 and $311 million more for 2001; the 2003 CAFR does not provide a note explaining the revisions. IBO uses the numbers reported from 2003 forward.
3Fiscal years 2000, 2002, and 2003 include short-term bond anticipation notes outstanding at year-end of $515 million, $2.2 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively.
4For fiscal year 2000, Capital Lease Obligations to HHC and PCDC are reported jointly. 
5In FY 2008, JSDC bonds outstanding were redeemed with GO bond proceeds, resulting in the elimination of JSDC debt, a reduction in conduit debt outstanding and partially accounting for the increase in GO debt from 2007 to 2008
														
General Obligation:
General obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the city. City property tax collections are pledged first to pay the principal and interest on these bonds.
														
														
Treasury Obligations:
Treasury obligations are New York City bonds held as investments by the city or by the related entities covered here, including MAC and SFC. They are netted out in order to avoid double counting of the city's obligations.
														
Transitional Finance Authority:
Created in 1997, the Transitional Finance Authority (TFA) is a separate legal entity from the City of New York. TFA General Purpose Bonds are secured by the city's collections of personal income tax and, if necessary, sales tax.  Recovery Bonds, issued in response to the events of September 11, 2001 differ from general purpose bonds in that they are excluded from the calculation of outstanding TFA debt allowed under the debt limit.
														
TFA Building Aid Revenue Bonds:
In fiscal year 2006, the city was authorized by the state Legislature to assign to the TFA all or any portion of the state building aid payable to the city or its school district. The TFA in turn is authorized to issue bonds secured by the aid and dedicated to financing a portion of the city's educational facilities capital plan.
														
TSASC:
TSASC Inc. (formerly known as the Tobacco Settlement Asset Securitization Corporation) is a separate legal entity from the City of New York. TSASC bonds are secured by the corporation's purchase from the city of the future revenue stream under a settlement agreement resolving cigarette smoking-related litigation between the settling states and participating manufacturers.
														
Municipal Assistance Corporation for the City of New York:
The Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC) was a separate legal entity from the City of New York, created in 1975 and formally dissolved in 2008. With New York City experiencing a severe fiscal crisis in 1975, MAC allowed the city continued access to credit markets and assisted in the prevention of a default of city general obligation bonds. MAC bonds were secured by state collections of certain sales and compensating use taxes (imposed by the state within the city at rates formerly imposed by the city), the stock transfer tax, and certain per capita state aid.
														
Samurai Funding Corporation:
The Samurai Funding Corporation (SFC) was a separate legal entity from the City of New York, which issued Japanese yen-denominated bonds. The yen-denominated bonds were secured by the proceeds of New York City general obligation bonds held by SFC.
														
Conduit Debt:
The city makes annual appropriations from its general fund for agreements with other entities that issue debt to build or maintain facilities on behalf of the city. These agreements are known as ""leaseback"" transactions, where the city makes rental payments to the partner entity in an amount sufficient to pay the entity's debt service on the securities issued for the respective capital expenditures. These entities, though legally separate from the city, either provide services exclusively to the city, have governance boards whose majority is appointed by the city, or are otherwise subject to the city's imposition of its will on the activities of the entity.
														
Excluded Items:
IBO considered several other items for inclusion as outstanding debt of the City of New York that were ultimately determined not to constitute obligations of the city, including: outstanding bonds of the Fiscal Year 2005 Securitization Corporation (FSC), outstanding bonds of the Sales Tax Asset Receivable Corporation (STAR), notes of the Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corporation (HYIC), and general capital lease obligations.
														
FSC is a financing instrumentality of the city, formed for the purpose of issuing bonds, the proceeds of which were used to acquire securities, held in escrow, which economically defeased city general obligation bonds. As the general obligation bonds in question are included in the calculation of outstanding general obligation debt, the inclusion of the FSC bonds as well would constitute a double counting. As such, IBO does not count FSC debt outstanding toward total New York City debt outstanding.
														
STAR is a financing instrumentality of the city, formed for the purpose of issuing bonds, the proceeds of which were used to assume the remaining obligations of MAC. STAR pays the debt service on these bonds with revenues received from the Local Government Assistance Corporation, a state entity whose revenues are 1 percent of the statewide sales tax. The debt of STAR is not an obligation of the city, and the revenues used to pay STAR debt service would not accrue to the city in the corporation's absence. As such, IBO does not count STAR debt outstanding toward total New York City debt outstanding.
														
HYIC entered into an agreement with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to purchase from the MTA Transferrable Development Rights.  $200 million of notes were issued by HYIC, the proceeds of which were used to execute the transaction. Debt service on the notes was paid from the proceeds of the bonds issued by HYIC which are included in IBO's definition of outstanding debt under conduit debt.  Therefore, inclusion in outstanding debt of the notes in addition to the bonds would constitute a double counting. As such, IBO does not count HYIC notes outstanding toward total New York City debt outstanding.
														
In addition to the capital leases deemed to be debt obligations of the city under conduit debt, various city agencies have entered into leases that have been determined under generally accepted accounting practices to be capital leases. Unlike issuers of conduit debt, the lessors of these general lease obligations do not exist to provide services exclusively to the city, do not have boards the majority of whose members are appointed by the city, or are not otherwise subject to the city's imposition of its will on their activities. These general capital lease obligations do not constitute an obligation of the city toward any bonds or other borrowing. As such, IBO does not count general capital lease obligations toward total New York City debt outstanding.
